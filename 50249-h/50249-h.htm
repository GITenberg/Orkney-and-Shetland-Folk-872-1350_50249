<p>This paper is an attempt to describe the mixed
races which inhabited Orkney and Shetland
from the foundation of the Norse earldom, in
872, until the end of the rule of the Gaelic earls, <i>circa</i>
1350, and it is a first instalment of the evidence on
which a paragraph on “person-names” was founded,
in the <i>Introduction</i> to <i>Orkney and Shetland Records</i>,
vol. I.</p>

<p>The earliest inhabitants, of whom we have any
record, were the Picts, and the Irish papas and Columban
missionaries, who must have brought some Irish
settlers with them.</p>

<p>It has already been suggested that the Norse must
have settled in Orkney and Shetland, <i>circa</i> 664, among
the aboriginal race, the Picts, who would have become
their thralls, and with whom the settlers would have
intermarried.</p>

<p>The first Norsemen who came to Orkney and Shetland
would have been adventurers, and not settlers with
wives, families and thralls, such as later went to Iceland
and Orkney. Consequently such adventurers who
settled in the islands would naturally have intermarried
with the aborigines. This kind of male settlement may
have gone on for some time, before the actual <i>bona fide</i>
colonisation took place.</p>

<p>It has already been pointed out that Shetland was
not so fully colonised as Orkney, at the commencement
of the Norse migration, which appears to account for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the older Norse dialect forms in Orkney, and for the
survival of more Keltic island-names in Shetland.</p>

<p>A stronger Pictish strain is thus, on that account, to
be looked for in Shetland. The Norse would select the
easiest landing-places, while the Kelts would occupy
the inland and inaccessible places, as they did in the
Isle of Man. The two inland districts of Hara and
Stennes in Orkney are especially rich in the remains
of the pre-Norse inhabitants&mdash;stone circles, brochs,
etc.; and Ireland, the only sea-board of Stennes, is particularly
inhospitable for shipping.</p>

<p>Besides the archæological and topographical proof of
the continued residence of the Picts in Orkney and
Shetland, there is the much more reliable evidence of
anthropology, in the existence of a large strain of the
small and dark race in both Orkney and Shetland,
representing the aboriginal race, the later prisoners of
raids and the later settlers from Scotland. Allowance
must also be made for thralls brought from Norway.</p>

<p>Queen Auðr djúpauðga (deeply-wealthy) or djúpúðga
(deeply-wise), passed through Orkney, in the
ninth century, on her way to Iceland, with twenty
freed Irish thralls. After this, Einarr, grandson of earl
Torf-Einarr, went to Iceland from Orkney with two
Vestmenn (Irishmen). <i>Írar</i>, Irish, occurs in place-names
in Iceland, Orkney and Shetland, in each of
which latter there is an <i>Ireland</i>.</p>

<p>It will now be proved that there were only three possible
pure-bred Norse earls of Orkney and Shetland,
viz., the first three&mdash;Sigurðr hinn ríki, his son,
GuÞormr, and his nephew, Hallaðr.</p>

<p>The first earl of the main line was Torf-Einarr, who
was half Norse and half thrall, his mother being probably
of the pre-Norse dark race. His son, the next earl,
married a Gael, and after this, through repeated Gaelic
marriages, the succeeding earls in the Norse male line
were never more than a cross between Norse and Gael,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
sometimes almost approaching pure-bred Gaels, if the
rules of a modern breeding society are to be observed.
The same holds good of earl St. Rögnvaldr, a Norwegian,
who succeeded on the distaff side, his mother
being of Gaelic extraction. The Gaelic conversion of
the earls was completed on the succession of the Gaelic
earls in 1139.</p>

<p>The next step will be to show that the leading
families, some of which were related to the earls, were
also mainly of Gaelic descent, and in some cases probably
in the male line.</p>

<p>As the Gaels did not give up patronymics and begin
to assume permanent surnames (usually those of their
chiefs), until after 1350, those who settled in Orkney
before that, and became Norse in language and customs,
of course adopted the Norse, in place of the
Gaelic, patronymic, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>-son</i> for <i>mac-</i>. This was done
by the Gaelic earls in Orkney, in precisely the same way
as had been done by the Irish settlers in Iceland.</p>

<p>In reply to a query, Sir Herbert Maxwell writes:
“You ask me to fix a date ‘when patronymics flourished
and ceased in the Highlands?’ I think it would
be impossible to do so. There were few, if any, fixed
surnames in England or Lowland Scotland before the
middle of the thirteenth century, other than territorial
ones, derived from the feudal tenure of land. In the
Highlands, the adoption of fixed names appears to have
been indefinitely deferred. Such counties as Perth and
Dumbarton, being nearest the frontier of civilisation,
their people would find it convenient to conform to the
habit of their neighbours. In more remote districts the
shifting patronymic prevailed much longer, and when
it was abandoned individuals frequently assumed the
surname of their chief or the name of his clan, which
accounts for the old patronymic ‘Macdonald’ being the
third commonest surname in Scotland; Smith and
Brown being first and second.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>In the following description particular attention will
be called to personal appearance, character, habits,
superstitions, etc., as indications of descent.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">The Norse Earls.</span></h3>

<p>Earl Torf-Einarr, 875&ndash;910, was the illegitimate son
of the Norwegian earl Rögnvaldr, by a thrall mother
who was thrall born on all sides, <i>í allar ættir þrælborinn</i>.
He was therefore half Norse and half thrall.
His mother was probably of the pre-Norse small dark
race, the Finnar or Lappir, which may account for her
son being ugly, <i>ljótr</i>, one-eyed, <i>einsýnn</i>, but keen-sighted,
<i>skygnstr</i>, an expression which latterly meant
second-sighted, and capable of seeing elves, etc. He
saw, what others did not, Hálfdán há-leggr, the self-appointed
“king of Orkney,” bobbing up and down
on another island, and had a <i>blóð-örn</i>, blood-eagle,
carved on him.</p>

<p>His poetic genius may have been the result of the
mixture of Norse and Finn. He died of sickness, <i>sótt-dauðr</i>,
equivalent to <i>strá-dauðr</i>, straw-dead, died in
bed, an ignominious death for a víkingr.</p>

<p>Nothing is known of his wife, but, as he had children
before he left Norway, she was, probably, a Norwegian.</p>

<p>His children were earls Þorfinnr, Arnkell and
Erlendr, and two daughters, Þórdís, born in his youth,
in Norway (she was brought up by her grandfather,
earl Rögnvaldr, and married Þórgeirr klaufi, whose
son Einarr went to Orkney to his kinsmen, and as they
would not receive him, he bought a ship and went to
Iceland), and Hlíf, who had descendants in Iceland.</p>

<p>Earl Þorfinnr hausakljúfr (skull-cleaver), 910&ndash;963,
was the son of earl Torf-Einarr and an unknown
mother, probably Norwegian, so that he would be
three-fourths Norse and one-fourth thrall in descent.
He married Grelöð, a daughter of Dungað (Gaelic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
<i>Donnchadh</i>, Duncan), Gaelic earl of Caithness, and
Gróa, daughter of Þorsteinn rauðr.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>He is described as a great chief and warrior, <i>mikill
höfðingi ok herskár</i>, and died of sickness, <i>sótt-dauðr</i>,
and was buried in a mound, <i>heygðr</i>, in Rögnvaldsey
<i>á Haugs-eiði</i>, at Hoxa. The Saga reads <i>á Hauga-heiði</i>,
wrongly; this isthmus would have been called
<i>Haugs-eið</i>, how’s isthmus, because the Norse found
on it a large mound, which covered the ruins of a pre-Norse
round tower, in which the earl may have been
buried.</p>

<p>His children were earls Arnfinnr, Hávarðr ár-sæli
(of prosperous years), Hlöðver, Ljótr or Arnljótr, and
Skúli, and two daughters. Three of his five sons
married, in turn, the murdress Ragnhildr, daughter of
king Eiríkr blóðöx and the notorious Gunnhildr. She
killed her first husband herself. The second husband
was killed by his nephew Einarr klíningr (butter),
at the instigation of his aunt, who promised to marry
him, and for which deed he was thought to be a
<i>níðingr</i>, dastard. Preparatory to marrying the third
brother, she got rid of Einarr at the hands of his cousin
Einarr harðkjöptr (hard-jawed), who was in turn
slain by the third and last husband.</p>

<p>One cannot wonder at the character of Ragnhildr,
considering the antecedents of her mother Gunnhildr,
the reputed daughter of Özurr toti, a lord in Hálogaland.
She, probably a Finn, was found in a Finmark
cot, studying wizardry, and was brought to Eiríkr
blóðöx, who, struck with her great beauty, obtained
her in marriage. She was held guilty of having
poisoned king Hálfdán svarti. Her life was spent in
plotting and mischief. She is described in <i>Heimskringla</i>:
the fairest of women, wise and cunning in
witchcraft; glad of speech and guileful of heart, and the
grimmest of all folk. Fortunately, her daughter left
no descendants in Orkney.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>
<p>Earl Hlöðver (Ludovick or Lewis), 963&ndash;980, was the
son of earl Þorfinnr hausakljúfr, and Grelöð, who was
half a Gael, and so he was five-eighths Norse, one-eighth
thrall and two-eighths Gael. He is described as
a mighty chief, <i>mikill höfðingi</i>, and died of sickness,
<i>sótt-dauðr</i>. He married Eðna (Eithne), daughter of
the Irish king, Kjarvalr (Cearbhall). She was learned
in witchcraft, <i>margkunnig</i>, and wove a magic banner,
<i>merki</i>, in raven form, <i>hrafns-mynd</i>, for her son; and
predicted that those before whom it was borne should
be victorious, <i>sigrsæll</i>, but it would be deadly, <i>banvænt</i>,
to the bearer.</p>

<p>Their children were earl Sigurðr hinn digri, and a
daughter, Nereiðr or Svanlaug, who married earl Gilli
of Kola (Coll).</p>

<p>Earl Sigurðr hinn digri, 980&ndash;1014, was the son of earl
Hlöðver and an Irish Gael, and was 5/16 Norse, 1/16 thrall,
and 10/16 Gael. He was a mighty chief, <i>höfðingi mikill</i>,
and a great warrior.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> He was killed in the battle of Clontarf,
<i>Brjáns-bardagi</i>, in Ireland in 1014, with the fatal
<i>hrafns-merki</i> wound around him, as no one else would
bear his <i>fjándi</i>, fiend. He was converted to Christianity
by the sword-baptism of king Ólafr Tryggvason,
although he expressed his preference for the religion
and carved gods of his Norse forefathers, notwithstanding
any Christian teaching he may have received
from his Irish mother beyond witchcraft. He gave up
the confiscated óðul to the Orkney bœndr (for one
generation) in return for military services rendered
against the Scots. The name of his first wife is
unknown, and his second one was a daughter of Malcolm,
the Scot king. His children by his first wife
were Hundi or Hvelpr (Gaelic, <i>Cuilen</i>, who was baptised
with the name of his grandfather, earl Hlöðver),
Einarr rang-muðr, stern, grasping, unfriendly, and a
great warrior, Brúsi, meek, kept his feelings well in
hand, humble and ready-tongued, and Sumarliði.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>
<p>Earl Þorfinnr hinn ríki, 1014&ndash;1064, was the son of
earl Sigurðr digri and his second wife, a Gael, and was
5/32 Norse, 1/32 thrall, and 26/32 Gael in descent. He was
<i>bráðgjörr í vexti, manna mestr ok sterkastr</i>, early in
reaching full growth, tallest and strongest of men;
<i>svartr á hár</i>, black hair; <i>skarpleitr ok skolbrúnn</i>, sharp
features and swarthy complexion; <i>ljótr</i>, ugly; <i>nefmikill</i>,
big nose; <i>kappsmaðr</i>, an energetic man; <i>ágjarn bæði
til fjár ok metnaðar</i>, greedy of wealth and honour;
<i>sigrsæll</i>, lucky in battle; <i>kænn í orrostum</i>, skilful in
war; <i>góðr áræðis</i>, of good courage. King Ólafr found
that Þorfinnr was <i>miklu skapstærri en Brúsi</i>, much
more proud of spirit than his brother, Brúsi. Þorfinnr
gladly agreed with all the king’s proposals, but the
king doubted that he meant to go back on them,
whereas he thought that Brúsi, who drove a hard bargain,
would keep his word, and would be a <i>trúnaðar-maðr</i>,
faithful liegeman. The earl married Ingibjörg,
jarla-móðir, daughter of Finnr Árnason. He made a
pilgrimage to Rome, got absolution from the Pope, and
built the first cathedral in Birsa, Orkney, where he died.</p>

<p>He was liberal, in that he did that <i>frama-verk</i>,
honourable deed, by which he provided his <i>hirð</i>, bodyguard,
and many other <i>ríkis-menn</i>, mighty men, all
winter through, with both <i>matr ok mun-gát</i>, food and
ale, so that no man required to put up at a <i>skytningr</i>,
inn; whereas, kings and earls in other lands, merely
made a like provision only during Yule. Arnórr jarlaskáld
sang to his praise in his <i>Þorfinns drápa</i>, and
noted his liberal fare.</p>

<p>His children were earls Páll and Erlendr, who were
<i>miklir menn ok fríðir</i>, mickle men and handsome, and
so took after their Norwegian <i>móðurætt</i>, mother’s kin,
and were <i>vitrir ok hógværir</i>, wise and modest; taking
after their mother, a Norwegian, is in contrast to their
father, who was almost a pure-bred, black-haired,
swarthy Gael.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Earl Rögnvaldr Brúsason, 1036&ndash;1046, was the son of
earl Brúsi Sigurðarson and an unknown mother, and
the nephew of earl Þorfinnr hinn ríki. The <i>fríðastr</i>,
most handsome of all men; <i>hárit mikit ok gult sem
silki</i>, much hair, yellow as silk; <i>snimma mikill ok
sterkr, manna var hann gjörfiligastr bæði fyrir vits
saker ok svá kurteisi</i>, tall and strong, the most perfect
man was he both in wits and courtesy; <i>fríðastr sjónum</i>,
most handsome in face; <i>atgervi-maðr mikill svá at
eigi fanst hans jafningi</i>, an accomplished man without
an equal. Arnórr jarlaskáld said that he was the <i>bezt
menntr af Orkneyja-jörlum</i>, the most accomplished and
best bred of the earls of Orkney. From this description
one would imagine that his unknown mother and
grandmother had both been Norwegians. It is not
stated whether he was married or had any children.</p>

<p>Earl Páll Þorfinnsson, 1064&ndash;1098, was the son of
earl Þorfinn hinn ríki and Ingibjörg, a Norwegian,
after whom he took&mdash;handsome and modest. He was
thus 19/32 Norse and 13/32 Gael in descent.</p>

<p>He married a daughter of earl Hákon Ívarsson and
Ragnhildr, daughter of king Magnús hinn góði. Their
children were earl Hákon, and four daughters, Herbjörg
(ancestress of bishop Biarni), Ingiriðr, Ragnhildr
(ancestress of Hákon kló), and Þóra.</p>

<p>He was banished to Norway, in 1098, where he died.</p>

<p>From 1098 to 1103, Sigurðr (afterwards king Sigurðr
Jórsalafari), the eighty-year-old son of king Magnús
berfœttr, was earl of Orkney.</p>

<p>Earl Erlendr Þorfinnsson, 1064&ndash;1098, was the son of
earl Þorfinnr hinn ríki and Ingibiörg, a Norwegian,
and so was 19/32 Norse and 13/32 Gael in descent. He
married Þóra Sumarliðadóttir, whose mother and
grandmother are not mentioned, but her father was the
son of an Icelander. The earl was banished to Norway,
in 1098, where he died.</p>

<p>His children were, earl St. Magnús, Gunnhildr, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
married Kolr Kalason, whose son Kali became earl
Rögnvaldr, and Cecilia who married Ísak, a Norwegian,
whose sons were Kolr and Eindriði. He had a thrall-born
illegitimate daughter called Játvör (fem. of
Játvarðr, the Norse form of Edward), who had a son
called Borgar,&mdash;the earliest record of this name, which,
however, occurs in Norwegian place-names; they were
both, mother and son, rather disliked, <i>úvinsæl</i>.</p>

<p>Earl Hákon Pálsson, 1103&ndash;1122, was the son of earl
Páll Þorfinnsson and a Norwegian mother, and was 51/64
Norse and 13/64 Gael in descent.</p>

<p>He was <i>ofstopamaðr mikill</i>, a very overbearing man,
<i>mikill ok sterkr</i>, great and strong; and <i>vel menntr um
alla hluti</i>, well-bred, accomplished in every way. He
would be the <i>fyrirmaðr</i>, leader, over his cousins, and
thought himself better born, being the great grandson
of king Magnús hinn góði. He always wanted the
largest share for himself and his friends, and was <i>öfund</i>,
jealous, of his cousins. When abroad he suffered from
<i>landmunr</i>, home-sickness, and wanted <i>at sækja vestr til
Eyja</i>, to seek west to the <i>Isles</i> (Orkney). He consulted
a wizard as to his future. He murdered his cousin,
St. Magnús, in order to get the whole earldom, and then
made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. He ended by
being a good ruler, and died in the Isles.</p>

<p>It is not known whom he married, if he was wedded
at all; but his son, earl Páll, appears to have had a
mother other than his father’s known <i>frilla</i> or concubine.
She was a Gael, Helga, daughter of Moddan, a nobleman
rolling in wealth, <i>göfugr maðr ok vell-auðigr</i>, who
lived in Dalir, or Dalr, in Katanes. The Gaelic name
<i>Moddan</i> may be connected with the Irish <i>O’Madadhain</i>.
This man’s family of daughters was a disgrace even to
the morals of the twelfth century. After earl Hákon’s
death, Helga, aided by her sister Frakök, attempted to
murder her step-son, earl Páll, by means of a bewitched
garment, white as snow, <i>línklœði hvitt sem fönn</i>, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
they had sewn and embroidered with gold, but which
her own jealous son donned and paid the penalty. Earl
Páll, who naturally deemed that this precious article,
<i>gersemi</i>, had been intended for him, promptly cleared
them, and their family and dependents, <i>skulda-lið</i>, out
of the islands.</p>

<p>It was the opinion of earl Rögnvaldr that Frakök was
an old hag who would not do anybody good, <i>kerling
er til einkis er fær</i>. She was burnt alive in her
house by Sveinn Ásleifarson, for having instigated her
grandson Ölver rósta to burn Svein’s father in his
house. Moddan’s carlines and their offspring wormed
themselves into Orkney society. Frakök (a Gaelic
name?) married Ljótr níðingr (the dastard) of Sutherland,
and their daughter married Þorljótr of Rekavík
(in Orkney). Another daughter married Þorsteinn
fjaranz-muðr (dreadful mouth). Þorleif Moddansdöttir
was the mother of Auðhildr, the frilla of Sigurðr
slembi-djákn (the slim or tricky deacon), by whom he
had an illegitimate daughter, who married Hákon kló.
Sigurðr himself, was the illegitimate son of a priest,
Aðalbrigð. When he and Frakök came to Orkney a
great faction, <i>sveitar-dráttr mikill</i>, took place. He took
part in the slaughter of Þorkell fóstri, a man much
beloved in Orkney, for which the deacon was promptly
deported as an undesirable alien. As the pretended son
of king Magnús berfœttr, he, however, met a terrible
death with remarkable fortitude. Earl Hákon’s
children were: earls Haraldr slétt-máli (smooth-speaking)
and Páll úmálgi (the silent), Margrét, who married
Maddadh, the Gaelic earl of Atholl, and Ingibjörg, who
married Ólafr bitlingr (the morsel), king of Suðreyjar.</p>

<p>Earl St. Magnús Erlendsson, 1108&ndash;1116, was the son
of earl Erlendr Þorfinnsson and Þóra Sumarliðadóttir.
In descent, 51/64 Norse 13/64 Gael. In personal appearance
he was, great of growth, <i>mikill at vexti</i>; manly, <i>drengiligr</i>;
intellectual in appearance, <i>skýligr at yfirlitum</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
The saga is voluminous in a description of his good
qualities, etc., <i>e.g.</i>, he was a most noble man, <i>ágætastr</i>;
of good morals in life, <i>siðgóðr í háttum</i>; fortunate in
battle, <i>sigrsæll í orrostum</i>; a sage in wit, <i>spekingr at
viti</i>; eloquent and high-spirited and generous, <i>málsnjallr
ok ríklundaðr</i>; liberal of wealth and magnanimous,
<i>örr af fé ok stórlyndr</i>; wise in counsel and more
beloved than any other man, <i>ráðsvinnr ok hverjum
manni vinsælli</i>; gentle and of good speech, with kind
and good men, <i>blíðr ok góðr viðmælis við spaka menn
ok góða</i>; hard and unforbearing with robbers and
víkingar, <i>harðr, ok úeirinn við ránsmenn ok víkinga</i>;
he let murderers and thieves be taken and punished,
high and low, for robbery and theft and all bad deeds,
<i>lét hann taka morðingja ok þjófa, ok refsaði svá ríkum
sem úríkum rán ok þyfsku ok öll úknytti</i>; impartial in
judgment, <i>eigi vinhallr í dómum</i>; he valued godly justice,
<i>guðligan rétt</i>, more than rank, <i>mann-virðingar</i>;
munificent, <i>stórgjöfull</i>, with <i>höfðingjar ok ríkis-menn</i>;
but ever showed great solicitude and comfort,
<i>huggan</i>, for poor men, <i>fátækir menn</i>. Along with his
cousin, earl Hákon, he burnt a Shetlander, Þorbjörn í
Borgarfirði, in his house, and they slew their cousin
Dufnjáll, without any reason being assigned in either
case.</p>

<p>St. Magnús, as a youth, accompanied king Magnús
on his expedition in 1098, but refused to fight, because
he said he had no quarrel against any man there, and
he took a psalter, <i>saltari</i>, and sung during the battle.
He married an unknown Scotswoman of noble family,
he had no children, and was murdered by his cousin,
earl Hákon, on April 16th, 798 years ago.</p>

<p>Earl Rögnvaldr Kali hinn helgi, 1136&ndash;1158, was the
son of Gunnhildr, earl Erlends dóttir and Kolr Kalason,
a Norwegian, and thus 115/128 Norse and 13/128 Gael
in descent. He is described as a most promising man,
<i>efniligasti maðr</i>; of average growth, <i>meðal-maðr á<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
vöxt</i>; well set, <i>kominn vel á sik</i>; best limbed man,
<i>limaðr manna bezt</i>; light chestnut hair, <i>ljósjarpr á hár</i>;
a most accomplished man, <i>atgervi-maðr</i>. He numbered
nine accomplishments, <i>iþróttir</i>, viz., <i>tafl</i>, chess, <i>rúnar</i>,
runes, <i>bók</i>, book (reading and writing), <i>smíð</i>, smith
work, <i>skríða</i>, <i>á skíðum</i>, sliding on snow-shoes, <i>róðr</i>,
rowing, <i>hörpu-sláttr</i>, harp-playing, <i>brag-þáttr</i>, versification,
to which may be added a tenth, <i>sund</i>, swimming,
as he frequently <i>lagðist yfir vatnit</i>, in dangerous
places. The king gave him the name of earl Rögnvaldr
Brúsason, because his mother said that he had
been the most accomplished, <i>görviligasti</i>, of all the
earls of Orkney, and that was thought to bring good
luck, <i>heilla-vænligr</i>.</p>

<p>In 1134, he plotted with his disreputable Gaelic
relative, Ölver rósta, to oust earl Páll, but was not successful.
Like a good víkingr he was slain in 1158,
and was briefly described as <i>íþrótta-maðr mikill ok
skáld gott</i>, a very accomplished man and a good skáld.</p>

<p>The name and race of his wife are unknown. He
had a daughter, Ingigerð, who married Eiríkr stagbrellr,
in Sutherland (a grandson of one of Moddan’s
carlines, and whose mother had been the frilla of the
slim deacon), and their children were, earl Haraldr
ungi, who was slain in 1198, Magnús mangi (nobody;
<i>Mangi</i> is also a contracted form of <i>Magnús</i>, which is
sometimes spelt <i>Mangus</i> in Orkney documents), Rögnvaldr,
Ingibiörg, Elin, and Ragnhildr.</p>

<p>Margrét, daughter of earl Hákon Pálsson and Helga
Moddansdóttir, was 51/128 Norse, 77/128 Gael, and is
described as <i>fríð kona ok svarri mikill</i>, a beautiful
woman and very proud. She married Maddadh, the
Gaelic earl of Atholl, as his second wife, and was the
mother of Haraldr Maddaðarson, who became earl of
Orkney. After her husband’s death she returned to
Orkney and had an illegitimate son by Gunni, Svein’s
brother, for which he was outlawed. After that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
eloped with Erlendr ungi, of whom nothing is
known.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>


<h3 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">The Gaelic Earls.</span></h3>

<p>Earl Haraldr Maddaðarson, 1139&ndash;1206, was the son
of Margrét Hákons-dóttir and Maddadh, Gaelic earl of
Athole (Gaelic, <i>maddadh</i>, a dog), and was 51/256 Norse,
205/256 Gael. When about twenty years of age, he was
<i>mikill maðr vexti ok sterkr, ljótr maðr ok vel vitr</i>, a
big man in growth and strong, an ugly man and well-witted.
He was a <i>mikill höfðingi</i>, great chief; <i>manna
mestr ok sterkastr</i>, the tallest and strongest of men;
<i>ódæll ok skap-harðr</i>, overbearing and harsh.</p>

<p>He was twice married, viz., (1) Afreka, daughter of
Duncan, Gaelic earl of Fife, whom he repudiated, and
(2) Hvarflöð (Gaelic, <i>Gormflaith</i>), daughter of Malcolm,
earl of Morhæfi (Moray). The names of the children
of the first were, Heinrekr (Henry), Hákon, Helena,
Margrét, and by the second, Þorfinnr, Davið, Jón,
Gunnhildr, Herborg, and Langlíf. He allowed a rebellion,
against king Sverrir, to be hatched in Orkney,
for which he had Shetland taken from him in 1194,
when it was placed under the government of Norway,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
and was not restored to the earls till 1379.</p>

<p>Here the <i>Orkneyinga Saga</i> ends, and information
about the succeeding earls is derived from documents
few and far between.</p>

<p>Earl Haraldr Maddaðarson was succeeded by his
sons, earls Davið Haraldsson, d.s.p. 1214, and Jón
Haraldsson, slain, 1231, the latter having been predeceased
by his son, Haraldr Jónsson, who was
drowned in 1226.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Earl Jón Haraldsson was succeeded
by Malcolm, the Gaelic earl of Angus, from whom the
title was transferred to his kinsman (uncle or cousin),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
earl Magnús, who was succeeded by his son or brother,
earl Gilbert (Gaelic, <i>Gilleabart</i>), who was succeeded by
his son, earl Magnús Gilbertsson, who was succeeded
by his sons, earls Magnús and John and another earl
Magnús, after which the earldom passed to Malise,
(Gaelic, <i>Maoliosa</i>), Gaelic earl of Strathearn, through
his great grandmother, a daughter of earl Gilbert.
After Malise, the earldom, after an interregnum, passed
to his daughter’s son, Henry St. Clair, in whom the
earldom was vested in 1379. His grandson, earl
William, after the wadset of Orkney and Shetland to
Scotland in 1468&ndash;9, resigned his right to the earldom
to the crown of Scotland in 1472, when it was annexed
to the crown as a royal title.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>


<h3 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">The Gœðingar: Earl’s men.</span></h3>

<p>The suggestion of Vigfússon in the Oxford <i>Dictionary</i>
that the <i>gœðingar</i> of the earls of Orkney were
synonymous with the <i>lendir-menn</i> of the kings of
Norway can be amply proved by the Saga. One
explicit instance gives a clue to the whole mystery, viz.,
that of Kúgi, a gœðingr (of earl Páll), whom we find
living in Hreppisnes, now Rapnes, in Westrey. The
bú of Rapnes, Swartmeill, and Wasbuster, were, in
1503, described as <i>boardlands</i> or <i>borlands</i> of the old
earldom, paying no skattr. <i>Bordland</i> or <i>borland</i> is a
Scottish loanword, meaning, “land kept for the board
of the laird’s house.”<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The Oxford <i>New English Dictionary</i>
states that the form <i>bordland</i> is first found in
Bracton, c. 1250, by whom it is wrongly derived from
<i>bord</i>, a table, whereas it is from M. Lat. <i>borda</i>, a hut,
cot, and was applied to land held in <i>bordage</i> tenure
by a <i>bordar</i>, a villein of the lowest rank, a cottier. The
Gaelic <i>bòrlum</i>, royal castle lands, <i>borlanachd</i>, compul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>sory
labour for a landlord, must also come from the
same source.</p>

<p><i>Boardland</i> in Orkney is, therefore, a translation of
Old Norse <i>veizlu-jörð</i>, land granted in fief for military
service and for the entertainment of the superior when
on circuit. In accordance with the <i>Hirðskrá</i> of king
Magnús Hákonsson, the earl, while prohibited from
disposing of the earldom lands, was permitted to grant
earldom lands <i>at veita</i> or <i>at veizlu</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, in return for
military service and entertainment. It seems certain
that the same privilege was allowed by the older
<i>Hirðskrá</i>, which is now lost.</p>

<p>To return to Kúgi, he had the <i>upp-kvöð or útboð</i>,
the calling out of the levy, of ships and men, <i>leiðangr</i>,
in Westrey. As he was the instigator, <i>upphafsmaðr</i>,
of a secret þing, <i>laun-þing</i>, in Westrey, he probably
acted as the representative of the earl in the district
assembly, <i>héraðs þing</i>. The localities of the other
gœðingar support the above conclusion.</p>

<p>Þorkell flatr was also in Westrey; Þorsteinn Hávarðarson
Gunnason had the calling out of the levy in
Rinansey, and his brother Magnús that of the adjoining
island, Sandey, where there were the boardlands
of Brugh, Halkisnes, Tofts, Lopnes and Tresnes;
Valþjófr Ólafsson was in Stronsey, where there were
skatt-fré lands; Sigurðr á Vestnesi in Rousey, where
part of Westnes was old earldom land; and this leads
to the conclusion that the gœðingar also held skatt-land
as well as skatt-fré land of the earldom <i>at veita</i>;
Jón vængr abode in Háey, where there is boardland.
The earls also gave gifts, <i>veita gjafir</i>, to their friends,
the gœðingar.</p>

<p><i>Gœði</i> means, among other things, profits, emoluments,
etc. It seems certain that the <i>gœði</i> in Caithness,
which the king of Scotland restored to Sveinn Ásleifarson,
in 1152, were the <i>gœði</i> of the earldom, which he
had formerly held as gœðingr.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>The gœðingar of Orkney (and Shetland?) were thus
the feoffees of the earl of Orkney, from whom they
received grants of earldom land, <i>veizlu-jörð</i>, <i>at veita</i> or
<i>at veizlu</i>, in consideration of military service and the
entertainment of the earl, when on circuit. As the
feoffees of the earl’s <i>gœði</i>, or emoluments, they received
the name of <i>gœðingar</i>, corresponding to the <i>lendir-menn</i>,
landed men, of Norway, who were so-called
because they held land or emoluments from the king
for similar duties. A distinction in nomenclature had
to be drawn between the king’s and the earl’s feoffees.</p>

<p>As was to be expected, some of the gœðingar were
related to the earls&mdash;remunerative government offices
were then, as now, conferred on the relatives and
favourites of the rulers. Their military service included
the <i>upp-kvöð or útboð</i>, calling out of the <i>leiðangr</i>,
levy, the superintendence of the <i>vitar</i>, beacons,
etc.</p>

<p>Their civil functions probably included attendance at
the local assembly, <i>héraðs Þing</i>, the nomination of delegates,
<i>lögréttumenn</i>, to the jury, <i>lögrétta</i>, of the law-thing,
and generally the representation of the executive
in their respective districts.</p>

<p>As the callers out of the levy of ships and men, the
gœðingar were necessarily located at strategical points,
with easy access to the sea and in close touch with the
beacons.</p>

<p>Mr. J. Storer Clouston has suggested with regard to
the Orkney place-name, <i>Clouston</i>, older forms, <i>Cloustath</i>
and <i>Clouchstath</i>, which probably represent an
original *<i>kló-staðr</i>, claw-stead, that <i>kló</i> is “the original
proprietor’s name&mdash;possibly Hákon kló of the Saga.”<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Now Hákon kló, who flourished <i>circa</i> 1150, was a
gœðingr, and was presumably connected with the
islands of Sandey and Rinansey, over which his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
brothers were gœðingar, and there is no historical or
traditional evidence associating him or his family with
Clouston, in any way.</p>

<p>Dr. Jakob Jakobsen has pointed out that <i>kló</i>, f., a
claw, denotes, in Norse place-names, something projecting,
curved or pointed. It occurs in a large number
of place-names in Shetland, including an identical
name to that in Orkney, viz., Klusta, *<i>Kló-staðr</i>, <i>-staðir</i>,
a district situated on a headland between two
bights. Now the bú, or principal farm, of Clouston,
from which the whole township takes its name, is also
situated on a ness; and directly opposite to the
house is a claw-formed or curved tongue of land which
projects into the Loch of Stennes, which leaves no
possibility of a doubt as to the true origin of the name.</p>

<p>With regard to nicknames, those which are person
forenames in themselves, such as <i>brúsi</i>, buck, and
personifications such as <i>hlaupandi</i>, landlouper, etc., are
used in place-name formation; while nicknames which
merely point to an eccentricity in personal detail and are
attached to forenames, such as <i>kló</i>, finger-nail, <i>flat-nefr</i>,
flat nose, <i>rang-beinn</i>, <i>-eygr</i>, <i>-muðr</i>, wry-legged, squint-eyed,
wry-mouth, etc., do not lend themselves for place-names,
<i>quasi</i>, “flat-nose’s farm.” But even if such
nicknames were detached from their forenames and
applied to places, they would be in the genitive case,
<i>e.g.</i>, if Hákon kló had been known as kló (of which
there is no evidence) then his farm would have been
called *<i>Klóar-staðr</i>, Claw’s farm, not *<i>kló-staðr</i>, claw-farm,
which could only point to a claw-formation in
the place, such as we actually find in Clouston itself,
and hence the name.</p>

<p>Circumstantial evidence is against Hákon kló,
a gœðingr, with the <i>uppkvöð</i> of the <i>leiðangr</i>, levy of
ships and men, being landlocked in one of the very few
inland townships in Orkney, situated from two to
three miles from the nearest easy landing place. Earl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Haraldr Maddaðarson in going from Grímsey to Fjörðr
(Firth) by way of (Clouston and) Orkahaugr (Maes-howe),
chose Hafnarvágr (Stromness harbour) as his
landing place, and the same choice would be made now.</p>

<p>The nearest coast to Clouston is that of Ireland,
which is quite unsuited for shipping, owing to its
exposed position, shallow water, extensive beach at low
water&mdash;a place to be avoided by sea-going craft. Moreover,
it has been shown that the gœðingar were in the
occupation of earldom lands, of which there were absolutely
not a penn’orth in Stennes, and next to none in
the adjoining inland parish of Hara. This lack of earldom
land in these inland districts, corroborates the supposition
(p. xx), viz., that the earldom estate was
formed of the confiscated estates of the leading víkingar
of 872, which would naturally be situated on the
seaboard with easy landing places, which is a
characteristic of the earldom estate; while the two inland
and inaccessible districts of Stennes and Hara are
remarkable for their wealth of Pictish remains and
dearth of earldom lands.</p>

<p>The last notice we have of the gœðingar is in 1232,
when a shipload of them, <i>gœðinga-skip</i>, were drowned.
Possibly the eighteen men of Haraldr Jónsson, son of
earl Jón Haraldsson, who were drowned, along with
him, on June 15th, 1226, were also gœðingar.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>


<h3 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Individuals and Families.</span></h3>

<p>In 1106, Dufnjáll (Gaelic, <i>Domhnall</i>, Donald), son
of earl Dungaðr (Gaelic, <i>Donnchadh</i>, Duncan) was a
first cousin once removed on the father’s side, <i>firnari en
bræðrungr</i>, of earls Hákon and Magnús, by whom he
was slain. Dufnjáll’s grandfather must have been an
illegitimate son of earl Þorfinnr hinn ríki, who lived
mostly in Caithness, and was almost a pure Gael.</p>

<p>In 1159, Jómarr, a kinsman of earl Rögnvaldr, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
mentioned in Caithness, and his name may be the
Norse form of some Gaelic name.</p>

<p>In 1116, Gilli (Gaelic, <i>gille</i>, servant) was a <i>dugandi-maðr</i>,
a doughty or good man, with St. Magnús, and
probably a relative of the earl’s Gaelic wife.</p>

<p>Kúgi (G., Cogadh), 1128&ndash;1137, was a wealthy bóndi
and a gœðingr of earl Páll, and lived in Hreppisnes,
now Rapnes, in Westrey, which he would have held as
<i>veizlu-jörð</i>. Nothing is told of his family or relations.
He is described as a <i>vitr</i>, wise man, and had the
<i>uppkvöð</i>, calling out of the levy, in Westrey. As a
schemer himself, he smelt a rat when the invading earl
Rögnvaldr played a clever trick in getting the Fair Isle
beacon lit; and his pawky <i>eyrendi</i>, speech, thwarted
the internecine complications which that deed was
designed to arouse. Earl Rögnvaldr, however, unexpectedly,
landed in Westrey, whereupon the <i>eyjarskeggjar</i>,
the “island beards,” <i>hljópu saman</i>, louped
together, to get Kúgi’s <i>ráð</i>, advice, which was that they
should at once get <i>grið</i>, peace, from the earl; and he
and the Vestreyingar submitted to the earl and swore
oaths to him. One night, however, the earl’s men
caught Kúgi napping at a secret meeting for <i>svíkræði</i>,
treachery, against the earl. He was promptly put
<i>í fjötra</i>, in fetters. When the earl arrived on the scene,
Kúgi fell at his feet and <i>bauð</i>, offered or left, all his
case in God’s hands and the earl’s. He then tried to
shift the blame on to others, and asserted that he had
been brought to the þing, <i>nauðigr</i>, unwilling, and that
all the bœndr had wanted him to be the <i>upphafsmaðr</i>,
instigator, of the <i>ráð</i>, plot. The Saga states that Kúgi
pleaded his own cause <i>orðfærliga</i>, with great elocution
or glibly. Fortunately for Kúgi’s life, the humour of
the situation tickled the earl’s poetic fancy to such a
degree that he could not resist the temptation of letting
off steam in one of his habitual improvisations, stuffed
with scathing ridicule; a lasting punishment, more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
severe than the decapitation, or sound drubbing, which
the object of his poetic flight so richly deserved.</p>

<p>The earl referred to the fettered man before him as
a <i>kveld-förlestr karl</i>, a night-journey-hampered carl
or old duffer, and advised him, in future, never to hold
<i>nátt-þing</i>, night meetings&mdash;which Vigfússon says were
not considered proper. The earl, further, admonished
him that it was needful to keep one’s oath and covenant.
<i>Grið</i>, peace, was given to all, and they bound their
fellowship anew. Exit Kúgi, of whom nothing further
is related, beyond the one line which is preserved of
<i>Kúga drápa</i>, in praise of Kúgi, and which runs:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<i>Megin-hræddir ro menn við Kúga, meiri ertu hverjom þeira.</i><a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a><br />
All are afraid of Kúgi, thou outdoest them all.

<p>This can only have been intended as biting sarcasm.
His name and character indicate that he was a typical
bad Gael of his class.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Sveinn Group.</span></h3>

<p>The next persons to be described are the family,
relatives and companions of Sveinn Ásleifarson.</p>

<p>Ólafr Hrólfsson was a gœðingr of earl Páll, and
owned Gareksey (Gairsey) in Orkney, and another bú
in Dungalsbœr á Katanesi. He was a most masterful
man, <i>mesta afarmenni</i>, and his wife, Ásleif, was wise
and of great family, <i>vitr ok ættstór</i>, and most imperious,
<i>ok hin mesta fyrir sér</i>. In 1135, Ólafr had a great suite,
<i>sveit mikla</i>, á Katanesi, which included his sons Sveinn
and Gunni, and Ásbjörn and Murgaðr, sons of his
friend Grímr of Svíney. His wife also lived in Caithness
at this time. Their children were Valþjófr (an
English name), Sveinn, Gunni, all well-bred men, <i>vel-menntir</i>,
and a daughter, Ingigerðr. Ólafr had a
brother Helgi, who lived Þingvöllr in Hrossey, now
Tingwall in Mainland of Orkney, where the þing was
held.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>
<p>Sveinn Ólafsson, after his father’s burning, was
called Ásleifarson, after his mother. He married
Ingirið Þorkelsdóttir, a kinswoman of earl Haraldr
Maddaðarson, and the widow of Andrés of Suðreyjar
or Man. Their children were, Ólafr, and Andrés, who
married bishop Biarni’s sister, Fríða, and was the
father of Gunni, whose son, Andreas, was in Iceland
in 1235 (SS). Sveinn was a wise man and prophetic,
<i>forspár</i>, about many things, unfair and reckless,
<i>újafnaðarmaðr ok úfyrirleitinn</i>. When drinking with
his karlar he took to speaking, <i>hann tók til orða</i>, and
rubbed his nose, <i>ok gneri nefit</i>, and remarked, “it is
my thought” about so and so, and then mentioned his
foreboding, <i>hugboð</i>.</p>

<p>As an illustration of Svein’s masterful unfairness
may be mentioned his expedition against Holdboði. He
asked the earl for <i>lið</i>, assistance, and got five ships,
of which the captains were Þorbjörn klerkr (a grandson
of Frakök and a brother-in-law of Sveinn), Hafliði son
Þorkels flettis, Dufnjáll son Hávarðs Gunnasonar,
Ríkgarðr (Richard) Þorleifsson and Sveinn himself.
However, Holdboði judiciously fled, but they slew
many men in Suðreyjar and plundered wide and burnt
and got much booty, <i>fé</i>. On their return, when they
were to share their <i>herfang</i>, war spoil, Sveinn said that
they should all share equally except himself, who
should have a chief’s share, <i>höfðingja-hlutr</i>, because,
he said, he alone had led them, and the earl had given
them to him for help, <i>til liðs</i>, and he alone had a
quarrel with the Suðreyingar, and they none. Þorbjörn
thought that he had worked as much and had
been as much a leader, <i>fyrirmaðr</i>, as Sveinn. They also
wished all the ship-captains, <i>skipstjórnar-menn</i>, to have
equal shares, <i>jafnir hlutir</i>. But Sveinn would have his
own way, <i>vildi þó ráða</i>, and he had more men in the
Nes than they had. Þorbjörn complained to earl
Rögnvaldr about Sveinn robbing them of their shares,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
<i>göra hlut ræningja</i>. The earl said it was not the only
time that Sveinn was an unfair man, <i>engi jafnaðarmaðr</i>,
and the day of retribution would come for his
wrong-doing, <i>ranglæti</i>. Although the earl made good
what Sveinn had cheated him of, Þorbjörn declared
himself divorced from Svein’s sister. The declaration
made by him, <i>segir skilit við</i>, corresponds with old
Gulathinglaw, “ef maðr vill skiliast við kono sína þa
scal hann sva skilit segia at hvartveggia þeirra mege
heyra mal annars oc have við þat vatta.” The consequence
of this was hostility, <i>fjándskapr</i>, between
them, which had its advantage, as it was now a case
of “Foruðin sjást bezt við”&mdash;the wrongdoer can best
detect his fellow. In contrast with the above is Svein’s
sportsmanlike treatment of earl Rögnvaldr. When
earl Erlendr and Sveinn were at feud with earl Rögnvaldr,
on the latter’s return from his crusade, they
captured his ships and treasures. Sveinn claimed earl
Rögnvald’s treasures as his share of the spoil, which
he promptly sent back to the earl. Being a keen-sighted
man, he probably anticipated that his drunken ally, earl
Erlendr, would ultimately be defeated by earl Rögnvaldr,
whose treasures from the Holy Land may have
been curios and relics of no great market value in the
eyes of a víkingr.</p>

<p>Sveinn is further described as of all men the sharpest-sighted,
<i>skygnastr</i>, and saw things which others could
not see. It was the opinion of Jón vængr, junior, that
Sveinn was a truce breaker, <i>grið-níðingr</i>, and was true
to no man. When earl Haraldr advised him to give
up roving and twitted him with being an unfair man,
<i>újafnaðarmaðr</i>, Svein’s answer was <i>tu quoque</i>, and
there the discussion ended. The Saga sums him up
as “mestr maðr fyrir sér í Vestrlöndum,” the most
masterful man in the West, both of old and now, of
those men who had no higher <i>tignar-nafn</i>, rank,
than he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Of Svein’s relatives may be mentioned Eyvind
Melbrigðason (Gael., <i>Maelbrighde</i>, servant of St.
Bride or Bridgit). He was one of the <i>göfugir-menn</i>,
great men, with earl Páll, and superintended the earl’s
famous <i>Jóla-boð mikit</i>, great Yule feast, at which
Sveinn killed Sveinn.</p>

<p>Eyvind schemed to make his kinsman Sveinn
Ásleifarson quarrel with his namesake, Sveinn brjóstreip,
and having succeeded in this, he then plotted
with Sveinn to kill Sveinn, and arranged an artful
manœuvre, by which the second Sveinn, before he died,
killed his own relative, Jón, the only other witness of
the murder. Magnús Eyvindsson, by Eyvind’s arrangement,
took Sveinn by horse and boat to Damsey, where
Blánn sheltered him, and took him afterwards secretly
to the bishop. Blánn (Gael., <i>flann</i>, red), took charge
of the castle in Damsey. His father, Þorsteinn of
Flyðrunes, his brother Ásbjörn krók-auga (squint-eye),
and himself were all <i>údœlir</i>, overbearing, men.</p>

<p>Jón vængr, senior, a relative of Sveinn, abode in
Háey á upplandi. He was a gœðingr. His brother
Ríkarðr (Richard), abode in Brekka í Strjonsey; they
were notable men, <i>gildir-menn</i>. They burned Þorkell
flatr, a gœðingr, in the house which their kinsman,
Valþjófr, had owned. The earl had given Þorkell the
house for finding out where Sveinn (the brother of
Valþjófr) had fled to, after the murder for which he had
been outlawed.</p>

<p>Jón vængr, junior, was a systur-son of Jón vængr,
senior, and became earl Harald’s <i>ármaðr</i>, or steward.
He had two brothers, Blánn (Gaelic, <i>Flann</i>) and Bunu-,
or Hvínu-Pétr; (<i>buna</i>, a purling stream, and <i>hvína</i>, to
whistle or whine). These two were ignominiously disgraced
by Sveinn in a mock execution, to shame their
brother Jón, who had given Sveinn a bad character.</p>

<p>Of Svein’s companions may be mentioned Grímr,
in Svíney, a <i>félitill</i>, poor, man, and his Sons Asbjörn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
and Murgaðr (Gael., <i>Murchadh</i>, Murdock). Sveinn,
who was sýslumaðr for the earl in Caithness, on one
occasion, in his absence, deputed his office to Murgaðr,
who turned out <i>sakgæfinn</i>, quarrelsome, and <i>áleitinn</i>,
provocative, and was <i>úvinsæll</i>, unpopular, for his
<i>újafnaðr</i>, tyranny. Along with Sveinn, he did much
<i>úspektir</i>, uproars, <i>í ránum</i>, in plunder, in Katanes.</p>

<p>As has already been mentioned, Ólafr Svein’s father
was burnt in his house in Caithness at the instigation
of the hag, Frakök, whom Sveinn, in turn, burnt in
her house.</p>

<p>Svein’s father had estates both in Orkney and Caithness,
and as he resided in Caithness, where he had the
<i>yfirsókn</i>, the stewardship, of the earldom, and where
Sveinn was afterwards sýslumaðr, the family appears
to have been a Caithness one, and the Caithness Clan
Gunn claim to be descended from Gunni Sveinsson.
This, taken in conjunction with the personal characteristics
and the numerous Gaelic names of members
of the family, relations and friends, makes it probable
that these families were all of Gaelic descent in the male
line.</p>

<p>Sveinn brjóstreip, <i>circa</i> 1136, had a kinsman Jón,
of whose family nothing more is known. He was a
hirðmaðr of earl Páll, by whom he was well esteemed,
<i>metinn vel af honum</i>. He spent the summer in víking
and the winter with the earl. He was a <i>mikill</i> man and
<i>sterkr</i>, strong, <i>svartr</i>, of dark complexion, and rather
evil-looking, <i>úhamingju-samligr</i>, he was a great wizard,
<i>forn mjök</i>, and had always sat out at night (as a wizard),
<i>úti setið</i>, in order to raise <i>troll</i>, ghosts, which, in
accordance with Old Gulathinglaw, was <i>úbótaverk</i>, an
unfinable crime punished by outlawry. He was one
of the earl’s forecastle men, <i>stafnbúi</i>, and was the foremost
of all the earl’s men in battle, and fought bravely,
<i>barðist all-hraustliga</i>. Sveinn preferred “sitting out”
to attending midnight mass on Yule. The bishop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
hailed his slaughter as a cleansing of the land of miscreants,
<i>land-hreinsan</i>. It was the opinion of Ragna
of Rinansey, that the earl had little scathe in Sveinn,
even though he were a great warrior or bravo, <i>garpr
mikill</i>, and that the earl had suffered much unpopularity,
<i>úvinsældir miklar</i>, through him.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt as to the race of the swarthy
wizard Sveinn, notwithstanding his Norse name. With
him compare the Icelandic-named Gaelic witch, Þórgunna,
in <i>Eyrbyggja Saga</i>.</p>

<p>Hávarðr Gunnason, <i>circa</i> 1090, was a gœðingr, who
married Bergljót, daughter of Ragnhildr, daughter of
earl Páll. Their children were Magnús, Hákon kló,
Dufnjáll (Gael., <i>Domhnall</i>, Donald) and Þorsteinn.
Hávarðr was on board earl Hákon’s ship, on the way
to the last meeting with earl St. Magnús; and when he
was informed that Magnús was to be killed, he jumped
overboard and swam to a desert isle, rather than be
party to the martyrdom.</p>

<p>Dufnjáll Hávarðsson and one Ríkarðr (Richard),
were worst in their counsel against Sveinn, when he
was in trouble with the earl about Murgað’s goings on.
His brother, Hákon kló, married the illegitimate
daughter of Sigurðr slembidjákn, by a daughter of one
of Moddan’s carlines. The names Gunni and Dufnjáll
appear to point to the Caithness origin of this family,
as well as does the Caithness marriage of Hákon kló.</p>

<p>Þorljótr í Rekavík, 1116&ndash;26, married Steinvör digra,
(the stout), daughter of Frakök Moddansdóttir and
Ljótr níðingr (the dastard), in Suðrland. Their son was
Ölvir rósta (the unruly); a great and powerful man,
<i>manna mestr ok ramr at afli</i>, turbulent, <i>uppivöðslumaðr
mikill</i>, and a great manslayer, <i>vígamaðr mikill</i>.
He, at the instigation of his grandmother, Frakök,
burnt Ólafr, Svein’s father, in his house. Their other
children were Magnús, Ormr, Moddan (Gaelic), Eindriði,
and a daughter, Auðhildr. The whole of this nest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
left Orkney with Frakök, in her repatriation, under
whose evil influence they were reared.</p>

<p>Notices of Shetland, in the Saga, are to all intents
and purposes nil. We find among the Shetlanders who
were taken to be healed at St. Magnús’ shrine two
bœndr, viz., Þorbjörn, son of Gyrð (O.E. Gurth), and
Sigurðr Tandarson, who abode in Dalr, in north Shetland,
and who was <i>djöful-óðr</i> or <i>ærr</i>, possessed or mad.
Tandr, or Taðkr, is E.Ir. <i>Tadg</i>, and the Shetland
Tandarson = Gaelic <i>M’Caog</i>, Ir., <i>Mac Taidhg</i>, MacCaig,
son of Teague.</p>

<p>The Irish Gaels, who settled in Iceland in the ninth
century, proved to be desirable and enterprising
colonists, the admixture of whose blood helped to form
the Icelandic genius in saga and song. They readily
adopted Icelandic patronymics and names, and gave up
their Christianity for the Norse religion. Their presence
is commemorated there to this day in Irish place-names
and in the continued use of Irish person-names.</p>

<p>The Scottish Gaels who settled in Orkney were, in
accordance with the Saga, in some cases undesirable
adventurers, of evil reputation, loose habits, glib, mischief-makers,
oath-breakers, witches and wizards. They
do not appear to have endowed their offspring with
traits other than their own, combined with a personal
appearance which is usually described as unattractive.</p>

<p>Gaelic names of residents in Orkney first make their
appearance in the late eleventh century in the family of
Hávarðr Gunnason, who was probably a Caithness Gael.</p>

<p>The differentiation between the Norwegians and the
mixed Gaelic-Norse race in Orkney, is unmistakably
brought into prominence in the middle of the twelfth
century, when the Norwegian contingent of the famous
crusade, which wintered in Orkney, got on so ill with
the islanders that it resulted in murder and bloodshed
about love and mercantile affairs.</p>

<p>The earls who were of Gaelic descent in the female<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
line, while exhibiting Gaelic features, were also good
rulers and great warriors, whose exploits provided good
copy for the <i>Orkneyinga-Saga</i>, which was probably
written down by Icelanders. The Gaelic admixture of
blood in Orkney does not appear to have produced any
literary or poetic talent such as it did in Iceland.</p>

<p>As mentioned in a previous paper,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> the <i>Orkneyinga
saga</i> consists of only two complete sagas, viz. (1) <i>Jarlasögur</i>,
earls’ sagas, the history of earl Þorfinnr hinn
ríki and his joint earls&mdash;his brothers, and his nephew,
Rögnvaldr Brúsason, 1014&ndash;1064, and (2) <i>Rögnvalds
saga hins helga</i>, the story of earl St. Rögnvaldr, 1136&ndash;1158,
brought down to the death of Sveinn Ásleifarson,
1171. The first of these sagas is prefaced with a summary
of the sagas of the preceding earls, 872&ndash;1014, of
which none have been preserved, while the second is
prefaced with a summary of the sagas of the earls, 1064&ndash;1136,
the period between the first and the second sagas,
of which we have preserved St. Magnús’s saga, 1108&ndash;1116.
The saga of earl Haraldr Maddaðarson, 1139&ndash;1206,
is partly preserved in the second saga, and in
<i>Flateyjarbók</i>.</p>

<p>As regards Orkney poets, earl Torf-Einarr, the skáld,
was a Norwegian by birth and family, with a thrall
mother, probably Finnish, from which admixture of
Norse and dark races he probably derived his ugly
appearance and poetic genius.</p>

<p>Earl St. Rögnvaldr, the skáld, was also a Norwegian
by birth, and the son of a Norwegian father, while his
mother was an Orkney woman of Gaelic extraction.
Bishop Biarni, the skáld, was the only Orkney born
poet, but his father was also a Norwegian, and his
mother an Orkney woman of Gaelic extraction. It is
just possible that these two last-named skálds derived
their poetic inspiration from just the right dash of
Gaelic descent.</p>




<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>
<p>All the other poets, whose compositions are recorded
in the saga, were Icelanders: Arnórr Jarlaskáld, Hallr,
etc. It goes without saying that Orcadians and Shetlanders
must have been, like their fellow Norsemen of
the period, improvisers, whose verses, although referred
to, have not been preserved.</p>

<p>There were only two Orkney saints, viz., earls
Magnús and Rögnvaldr, the one was martyred and the
other assassinated, and both of them had very little
Gaelic blood.</p>

<p>It is a question whether Orkney and Shetland, with
their Christian Picts and heathen Norse, in the seventh,
eighth and ninth centuries, were the birth-place of
some of the Edda lays; and whether any of these lays
were current there, as oral tradition, and taken down
in writing in the twelfth century by earl St. Rögnvaldr
and his Icelandic skálds. The solitary preservation and
use of many Edda poetic words in Shetland is significant.
The first notices we have of writing in the saga
are in 1116, when Kali Kolsson, afterwards (1136), earl
Rögnvaldr Kali, in a verse, numbered among his
accomplishments, <i>bók</i>, reading and writing, and, in
1152, when earl Erlendr produced king Eysteinn’s <i>bréf</i>,
letter, at the þing in Kirkjuvágr.</p>

<p>With regard to person-names, it will have been noted
that the Norse earls in the male line, although half
Gaels, always gave their children Norse names, while
the Gaelic earls, who were only of slight Norse descent,
gave their children Norse, Gaelic and English names.
So that the gœðingar and other leading families of the
late eleventh and early twelfth centuries, who also gave
their children Norse, Gaelic and English names, were
therefore probably, like the Gaelic earls, also of Gaelic
descent in the male line. This is also in accordance
with the known practice of other Gaelic settlers in
Iceland, etc.</p>

<p>The non-Norse characteristics of persons of Gaelic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
descent are most pronounced&mdash;black hair, swarthy
complexion, quarrelsome, given to witchcraft, pawky
and glib, oath-breakers, etc., which perhaps point to
the Iberian element rather than to the true Gael; and
that in comparison with the Norse&mdash;fair-haired, accomplished
and well-bred, generous, makers of hard
bargains, which they, however, kept, true to their
word, etc.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that these comparative characteristics
are the observations of the Norsemen themselves,
who wrote the saga, probably Icelanders, and
therefore, presumably, exaggerated in their own
favour. They are valuable, however, in placing
beyond doubt the large strain of non-Norse people
who lived in Orkney.</p>

<p>It has been shown that the Gaelic earls, 1139&ndash;1350,
adopted Norse patronymics, and that all persons in
Orkney and Shetland before 1350 used Norse patronymics,
including the numerous Gaelic families, which
must have settled in the islands. There was no other
alternative, just as it was, conversely, the case in the
Hebrides, where the Gaels predominated, and where
their language prevailed, and was adopted by the
Norsemen. Here the Norse <i>Goðormsson</i> became
Gaelic <i>M’Codrum</i>, <i>Þorketilsson</i>: <i>M’Corcodail</i>, <i>Ivarsson</i>:
<i>M’Iamhair</i>, etc., etc. Compare also the case in
Ireland.</p>

<p>Gaelic names in Orkney and Shetland in their Norse
form have already been dealt with.</p>

<p>The blending of Norse and Gael in the Hebrides does
not appear to have been more successful than in
Orkney, since we find, in 1139, that earl Rögnvaldr
said that most Suðreyingar were untrue, and even
Sveinn Ásleifarson put little faith in them.</p>

<p>The use of Norse names and patronymics by the
leading Gaels in Caithness, who are alone mentioned
in the Saga, is accounted for by the fashion set by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
their Norse earls, as well as through the influence of
Norse marriages. While the leading people must have
been bilingual, speaking Norse (the court language),
and Gaelic, the <i>almúgi</i>, or common people, appear to
have maintained their native Gaelic. This is indicated
in two striking instances in the Saga. In 1158, earls
Haraldr and Rögnvaldr went from Þórs-á up Þórs-dalr
and took <i>gisting</i>, night quarters, at some <i>erg</i>, which
“we call <i>setr</i>.” The local Gaelic name of such a shieling
was <i>àiridh</i>, E. Ir. <i>airge</i>, <i>áirge</i>. In 1152, earl
Haraldr, who was living at Víkr, dispersed his men
<i>á veizlur</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, quartered them on various houses, in
accordance with the obligations of the householders,
during Páskar, Easter; then the Katnesingar said that
the earl was on <i>kunn-mið</i>. Vigfússon suggested that
this word was some corrupt form of a local name;
Dasent translated it “visitations,” and Goudie “guest-quarters,”
which is correct, as <i>kunn-mið</i> must be
Gaelic, <i>comaidh</i>, a messing, eating together, E. Ir.
<i>commaid</i>; <i>cf.</i> Gaelic <i>coinne</i>, <i>coinneamh</i>, a supper, a
party, to which everyone brings his own provisions,
E. Ir. <i>coindem</i>, <i>cionmed</i>, quartering. In both these
cases the E. Ir. spelling comes nearer to the Norse than
the Scottish Gaelic does, and corresponds to the Scottish
Gaelic of the twelfth century.</p>

<p>The fact that the earl had the right to quarter his men
in Orkney and Shetland, is preserved in the tax, <i>wattle</i>
&lt; <i>veizla</i>, which was paid in lieu of actual entertainment.
This tax continues to be paid to this day.</p>

<p>“The Inhabitants of Orkney and Shetland after
1350,” will be the subject of a future paper; meanwhile
it may be emphasised that the Gaelic earls of Orkney
failed in the male line before the Scots began to assume
permanent surnames. The Gaelic earls were succeeded,
in the female line, by the Lowland-Norman family of
St. Clair, bearing a hereditary surname, about the time
of whose arrival began the Lowland-Scottish settlement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
of Orkney, to the influence of which must be attributed
the assumption of the Lowland Scottish language and
the adoption of place-surnames, and not fixed patronymics,
in Orkney, by the Norse-Gaelic inhabitants.
Shetland, being far removed from the seat of government
and fashion, continued the use of patronymics
until the nineteenth century, when they became fixed.</p>

<p>The great number of persons in Orkney and Shetland
bearing the names of Tulloch and Sinclair appears to
indicate that the ancestors of some of them may have
been tenants of the bishopric and earldom who, in
accordance with Gaelic custom, assumed the names of
their lords of that ilk. The Tulloch bishops ruled,
1418&ndash;1477, and the Sinclair earls and lessees, 1379&ndash;1542,
the period during which patronymics were giving place
to hereditary surnames in Orkney. Tulloch and
Sinclair may also have been Christian names which
became stereotyped as patronymics and the “son”
termination afterwards dropped, as in the case of
Omondson, &gt; Omond.</p>

<p>Shetlanders pride themselves in their geographic
detachment from Orkney with its Scottish people and
customs, and claim to be regarded as purer Norsemen
as compared with the Scots of Orkney. Perhaps it is
owing to this qualified humdrum purity that the
Shetlanders did not achieve any deeds of sufficient
interest to be recorded in the Saga. However, from
an anthropological point of view, the Pictish and small
dark strain is as much in evidence in Shetland as in
Orkney, and perhaps more so.</p>

<p>In the twelfth century even an ordinary Shetland
<i>bóndi</i>, farmer, had his thrall, and <i>manfrelsi</i>, giving a
thrall his freedom, is mentioned as an ordinary transaction.
The thrall element must therefore have formed
a large proportion of the population, and intermarriage
must have taken place between the Norse and the thralls.
We find the earls had children by thralls, and intermarriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
between the bœndr and thralls, especially the
freed thralls, must also have taken place.</p>

<p>Persons of mixed racial descent are usually very loud
in an exaggerated appreciation of the heroic line of their
ancestry, especially when it is on the distaff side,
usually coupled with an inverse depreciation of the
other ascent which is represented by an inappropriate
and inconvenient surname.</p>

<p>There would be no necessity for a genuine Norse
islander to crow himself hoarse on his native rock; and,
to do so, would indicate that there were grave doubts
as to the purity of his strain.</p>

<p>Hitherto the Norse traditions of Orkney and Shetland
have been solely espoused by outlanders and by natives
bearing surnames which leave no doubt as to their
foreign origin.</p>

<p>The most voluminous history of Shetland was written
by an English tourist, Dr. Hibbert, afterwards Dr.
Hibbert Ware. But then, the English are noted for
their greater interest in the history and antiquities of
countries other than their own, which may be accounted
for by the exceptional variety of races which they
represent.</p>

<p>But after all the land makes the man. If it had not
been for these northern islands there would have been
no <i>Orkneyinga Saga</i> with its verses and narratives of
stirring events.</p>

<p>Dr. John Rae, first honorary president of this Society,
was a Scottish Gael born in Orkney (where his father
had settled), an Orkneyman of Orkneymen; and to his
youthful training, experience in boating, and his
environment in these islands, he attributed his success
in Arctic exploration.</p>

<p>And, moreover, it is well known that Orkney and
Shetland supply the British Navy and mercantile
marine with a deal more than their due share of
personnel, and have given the British colonies a good
supply of useful pioneers and settlers.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
